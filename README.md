# MountsJournal ElvUI Skin

This addon reskins the MountsJournal addon for ElvUI.

</div>

It requires both MountsJournal and ElvUI to be installed and enabled and does not include any portion of either addon. If you don't already use both addons then this addon will have no effect.

MountsJournal can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sfmict/MountsJournal).<br>
ElvUI can be downloaded [here](https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui).
